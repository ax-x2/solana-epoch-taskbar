# Solana Epoch Tracker

MacOS Menu Bar Extension that shows the Solana Epoch for Mainnet, Testnet or Devnet.
The extension shows you also the remaining time for that epoch, the last current slot at the time the data was fetched and the network status.
It fetches new data always when you click on it, to avoid getting rate limited by the public RPCs.
Data is fetched by the public Solana Foundation RPCs.
